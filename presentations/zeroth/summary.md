# Zeroth Presentation Speaker Notes

## Introduction (`Nihal`)

- We want to build a 32-bit operating system/ kernel
- We will use the C programming language and x86 assembly
  - The reasoning behind why we did not choose a modern programming language like Rust will be explained in the later slides.
- Our three basic goals are:-

  ### 1. Implement Display

  - This involves printing text to the screen and drawing geometric shapes such as squares, triangles and so on ...
  - Drawing text to the screen
  - In our current design, we are using VGA text-mode and graphics-mode.  
    This involves writing 2 bytes to memory location _0xB8000_ to represent a character.

  ### 2. Input Drivers

  - This involves implementing both keyboard and mouse drivers from scratch.
  - Implementing keyboard driver involves reading scan codes from the PS/2 controller
  - Implementing mouse driver involves handling interrupts

  ### 3. C standard library

  - The functions that we take for granted - like strlen and printf, scanf, malloc are
    all parts of the C standard library.
  - They are not provided by the compiler.
  - It is upto the kernel to provide these libraries
  - We will implement some parts of the stdlib (like string.h and malloc function)

- Since it is not really practical, we will exclude things like networking.

## Motivation (`Antony`)

- Writing low level code is hard and we wanted to do something **hard**.

  - _Illustrate the difficulty by mentioning the steps needed to setup a compiler_:
    1. First install 8 different dependencies.
    2. Download and **compile** binutils (for GNU linker and assembler).
    3. Download and **compile** GCC as a cross-compiler.
    4. Get a bootloader (eg: GRUB).
    5. Write custom linker script.
    6. Build a bootable image of your kernel.
    7. Now you have a clean slate. No printing, no keyboard, no mouse functionality.
  - Makes you appreciate the built-in abstractions.  
    Example:
    - We call a function and text magically appears on the screen
    - When the user presses a key, an event is triggered

- We want this project to be used in conjunction with Operating System classes (CS204).

  - Students end up having a good theoretical understanding but have no idea how to implement the concepts in code.
  - Students can examine the codebase to understand how the concepts are implemented.
  - This can encourage to students to contribute code to linux kernel and other open source projects.

- Additionally we want students to understand how to write clean code and design good system architectures.

- Students can also be introduced to basic concepts of devOps such as:
  - How to use source control and proper ettiquettes to follow when commiting and so on ...
  - How to do unit testing
  - How to write testable code
  - How to design workflows that shorten development cycles etc ...

## Existing Technology (`Mathew`)

- Linux Kernel

  - Extremely large; contains about 27.8 million lines of code
  - Code is complicated since it supports a large variety of architecturally dependent devices
  - Compiling takes a long time - about 1 hour

- Windows Research Kernel

  - Not open source
  - Difficult to get access
    - Needs to register through University
  - Outdated - Not in development

    - Based on older windows XP / Server 2003 code ; Therefore outdated

  - Minix microkernel

    - The best introductory kernel out of all the ones mentioned here
    - Developed by Andrew S. Tanenbaum  
      (Fun Fact: If the name sounds familiar it's because he authored our computer networks textbook)
    - However, the kernel has a micro-kernel design instead of the familiar monolithic kernel
      - Traditional unix based kernels (eg: linux) follow monolithic design
      - This has led to the famous [Tanenbaumâ€“Torvalds debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate).
      - Explain [micro-kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel) & [monolithic kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel)

  - Redox

    - Similar to MINIX (based on microkernel design)
    - Written in Rust programming language
      - Rust is a systems programming language with guaranteed safety
    - Has all the disadvantage of MINIX
    - Additionally students have to learn the Rust Programming language

  - Proposed System
    - The system we propose will be written primarily in C; a language that is familiar to all undergraduate students
    - It will have a monolithic design; so that the knowledge and experience gained by tinkering with out project can directly translate when the student starts to play with the Linux kernel
    - Open source
    - Plenty of documentation

## Requirements (`Midhun`)

- End user

  - Since we're developing a kernel/OS, the requirements for the end user is verey minimal
  - The primary requirement is that the user has a Intel/AMD CPU with atleast 1 GB of RAM.
  - We also assume that the user has basic interface devices such as monitor, keyboard and mouse.
  - Disk space of 5GB is recommended

- Developer

  - Since the primary purpose of this project is to provide a minimal kernel that students can use to learn kernel development it makes sense to also state the requirements for developing the project.
  - This is a little more complicated

  - Requirements are:

    - Linux based distro

      - A stable linux distribution is recommended since most tools used for os-dev are written with POSIX compliance.
      - Previously, if you wanted to use Windows as your developer environment, you had to use cygwin and lot of hacks.
      - A lot has changed since 2020, this is not as strict of a requirement because of Windows Subsystem for Linux fully supports binutils and GCC.

    - Binutils

      - This include GNU Linker and Assembler
      - You have to download and compile them
      - Little involved; since some dependencies have to be installed as well

    - GCC Cross Compiler

      - When we normally compile a C/C++ program using GCC, the binary produced is for the system with which we compile.
      - During kernel development, we need to target another system architecture
      - This requires a Cross Compiler
      - Like with binutils, we need to download source code, install dependencies and compile the cross-compiler

    - GRUB

      - Once we have a kernel, we need a bootloader to load the kernel into main memory and branch to entry point of our kernel
      - Developing a custom bootloader is as big a project as developing a kernel
      - Therefore, we instead chose to use the GRUB Bootloader
      - Additionally GRUB also contains tools to verify multiboot

    - Virtual Machine

      - We heavily use code-build-debug cycle
      - It's not practical to actually install the kernel to a usb and to reboot into it every time we need to debug
      - So for convenience, we will use a virtual machine
      - We've used qemu - since its fast and can be operated easily from the terminal

    - Source Control

      - We use git
      - Main remote repo is hosted on Github
      - We also plan to backup the repo to Gitlab just for safety

    - Communication Platform
      - We are all at home; so we use discord to collaborate
      - We have Github integration with discord
