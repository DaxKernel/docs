Installing headers
--------------------

We have two directories : kernel and libc (See dir.md)
We use make to install our headers into sysroot/usr/include 

For both directories, make install-headers performs:
step 1) Create directory sysroot/usr/include if it does not exist
step 2) Copy everything from include folder to sysroot/usr/include

The actual compilation is done by executing make install on each of the 
previously mentioned directories:
This is a little more complicated than installing the headers.
You must be familiar with the variables used. (see shellscript.md)
Additionally you also need to be familiar with make. Use the resources 
in Initial_Resources.md

Make install on /kernel directory
--------------------
The make install command further calls two sub commands:
    1. make install-headers 
    2. make install-kernel

Sub-command 1 has been described in previous section.

install-kernel requires DaxOS.kernel to proceed -->
DaxOS.kernel requires OBJS and arch/i386/linker.ld to proceed -->
    where OBJS is [crti.o crtbegin.o crtend.o ...kernel.o ...]
the .o files require .c or .S files with same name
    These are available in the directory :)
    So compile .c files and .S files  to .o files
With these .o files, make will produce DaxOS.kernel by linking them
together
Then it is confirmed that multiboot is properly working

Now install-kernel proceeds by:
    step 1: create sysroot/boot directory if it does not exist
    step 2: copy DaxOS.kernel to sysroot/boot directory


Make install on /libc directory
--------------------
This will call two sub-commands:
    1. make install-headers
    2. make install-libs

Sub-command 1 has been described in previous section.

install-libs require libk.a file as prerequisite. 
.a files are archive files (like a zip or tar file). In fact you can open .a files to find a collection .c implementation files.

libk.a requires the items in LIBK_OBJS as prerequisite. LIBK_OBJS contains the items in FREEOBJS but with the ending .o replaced
by .libk.o.

The .libk.o files require .c/.S files as prerequisite. This is available. Therefore the .c/.S files are compiled by GCC to 
.libk.o files. Now libk.a can be produced by using GNU ar to combine all the .libk.o files into an archive.
Now install-libs can proceeds by:
    step 1: create sysroot/usr/lib directory if it does not exist
    step 2: copy the libk.a file to sysroot/usr/lib directory
