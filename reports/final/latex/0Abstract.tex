\section*{\centering ABSTRACT}

\indent {
Every computer science enthusiast is proficient in their operating system of choice. They may
even know its underlying working from an old operating system course they took in college.
However, it is usually the case that their knowledge and understanding is limited to theory and
writing low-level system code is often considered an insurmountable challenge.
This project hopes to change this attitude by developing a minimal yet functional 32-bit
operating system that can be used in conjunction with theoretical teaching to promote and
introduce systems programming. A minimal kernel guarantees easier to read source code (as
opposed to the 27 million SLOC Linux kernel) and provides a gentler introduction to kernel
development.
The kernel will include a full keyboard and mouse driver and will have support for VGA
text-mode and graphics. It will also contain a limited libc implementation with a streamlined
build process.
Additionally, this project will serve as an illustration for good development practices (code
reuse, clean architecture, unit testing).
The 32-bit kernel will be written in C with a little of assembly for the
truly low-level aspects.
