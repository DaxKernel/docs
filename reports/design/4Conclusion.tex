	This report has attempted to list the many design decisions that were available to the authors of this project and the justification for each such
	decision. UML diagrams for various interactions were also provided. This document and the decisions stated here are in no means final. DaxOS, like
	any other software project will undergo design changes as more functionality is implemented. However, the base of the design will more or less be static.
